"""Arbitration between concurrent development lanes on one shared repository.

Many agent sessions and humans work these repos at the same time, each in its own
git worktree. Every collision we have actually suffered has the same shape: **a
background or global actor mutates state a lane assumed it owned** — a sync that
resets a canonical checkout mid-pre-commit, a ``git stash`` against the one shared
``refs/stash``, a shared ``CARGO_TARGET_DIR`` that corrupts a concurrent build, a
venv swapped underneath a running test, a shared mutable YAML ledger clobbered by
a whole-file rewrite.

Writing the rules down did not work — every one of those rules was already
documented when it was violated. So this module makes the arbitration
*mechanical*: each shared resource is classified into exactly one of four classes,
and each class has one mechanism that makes the dangerous path fail loudly rather
than silently succeed.

``PARTITION``
    Stop sharing it. Derive a per-lane instance (cargo target dir, pytest
    basetemp, scratch, and a per-lane stash ref instead of ``refs/stash``).
    CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.lane-partitioned-resources

``APPEND-ONLY``
    Stop rewriting it. Each writer appends immutable records to *its own*
    fragment; a reconciler folds the fragments into a generated canonical view.
    Distinct files never merge-conflict and no writer can clobber another's
    record. CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.append-only-fragment-fold

``LEASE``
    Announce, then defer. A holder publishes a lease at the scope every lane
    shares; other lanes detect it and **defer instead of proceeding** (relock,
    venv swap, ``pre-commit --all-files``, a reconciliation merge).
    CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.shared-scope-lease

``READ-ONLY``
    Forbid it. The canonical checkout is not a place agents edit, and no global
    actor may reset a tree holding work it does not own.
    CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.canonical-checkout-immutable

The classification itself is data (``lane_resources.yaml``), not code, so adding a
resource is a one-row change: CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.lane-arbitration-classes.

**Why the shared git directory is the arbitration scope.** Every worktree of a
repository shares one ``--git-common-dir``. That directory is (a) reachable and
identical from every lane, (b) never rewritten by a checkout, reset, or merge, and
(c) not version-controlled, so it can neither conflict nor be clobbered by a
merge. It is the only location with all three properties, which is exactly what an
arbiter needs.

    of ``AF_UNIX``'s 108-byte ``sun_path`` for anything a fixture appended —
    its own per-test subdirectory plus a socket filename — so *any* Unix-socket
    fixture under a lane basetemp failed deterministically on path length
    alone (measured: a 99-char basetemp produced a 158-byte socket path and a
    live-engine subprocess that could not bind it). Living inside ``.git`` had
    a second, independent cost: a supposedly hermetic ``git -C <tmp_path>
    remote get-url origin`` resolved to the **canonical repo's own origin**,
    leaking its identity into tests that believed themselves isolated.

    The default ``~/.al/<token>`` fixes both — short (~35-45 chars total,
    comfortably inside ``sun_path``) and outside every repo's ``.git``.
    Operators that need the lane volume on another disk-backed filesystem may
    set ``AU_LANE_TEMP_ROOT`` to one short absolute directory (for example,
    ``/var/tmp/al-<uid>``). The same token is appended to that root, so the
    override changes placement without changing lane identity or isolation.
    ``/home`` was chosen for the default over ``/tmp`` because ``/tmp`` here
    is a RAM-backed ``tmpfs`` that has already hit 100% swap under concurrent
    lane load; a configured root is the explicit escape hatch for hosts where
    the default filesystem is constrained.

    ``token`` hashes ``(common_dir, lane)``, **not** ``lane`` alone: every
    repo's canonical checkout is independently named lane ``"canonical"``, so
    hashing the lane name alone would collapse the canonical checkout of
    *every* repo in the workspace onto one path — exactly the PARTITION

    them. A per-lane ref makes concurrent stashing safe, and is the only reason
    the blanket never-stash rule can ever be relaxed.

    overflow + a git-identity-leak that both traced to the same `.git`-nested
    location). When the override is configured, Cargo uses that same lane root
    under ``cargo/``; this keeps every high-volume partition on the selected
    disk-backed filesystem.

    ``temp_root`` is created here (``mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)``),
    mirroring :func:`workspace_arbitration_dir`'s same pattern for the other
    host-wide resource root. Without it, a freshly-hashed token's directory
    does not exist yet, and pytest's own ``TempPathFactory.getbasetemp()``
    creates only ``--basetemp`` itself (``mkdir(exist_ok=True)``, no
    ``parents=True``) — so the very first ``pytest`` invocation under a new
    lane's exported ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` failed with a raw
    ``FileNotFoundError`` on ``<temp_root>/pytest``, one lane env call before
    any test code ran.

    ``precommit_home`` is the pre-commit store (D-ORC-37). ``PRE_COMMIT_HOME``,
    or ``XDG_CACHE_HOME/pre-commit`` when unset (verified in
    ``pre_commit/store.py``), is where
    ``staged_files_only._unstaged_changes_cleared`` writes a lane's UNSTAGED

    ``pre_commit/commands/run.py`` passes ``store.directory`` — the very
    directory holding pre-commit's SQLite ``db.db`` — as that patch_dir).
    ``PRE_COMMIT_HOME`` was exported nowhere in this codebase, so every lane
    shared ONE store, producing two independent hazards: a killed/OOMed/
    power-lost pre-commit strands a lane's unstaged work as an orphaned patch
    file nobody replays (D-OB-12; see :func:`orphaned_precommit_patches`), and
    the shared ``db.db`` raised ``OperationalError: database is locked`` under
    concurrent lanes (lane-concept-docs-0801). Partitioning the store removes
    both: each lane's patches and SQLite state are invisible to every other
    lane's pre-commit. It is NOT created here — pre-commit's own ``Store``

    POSIX: ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` — the decades-old idiom. Signal 0 delivers no
    real signal; the kernel only validates that the target pid exists and is
    signalable by this process, raising ``ProcessLookupError``/
    ``PermissionError`` instead of actually affecting the target.

    Windows: **not** ``os.kill(pid, 0)``. CPython's Windows implementation
    of ``os.kill`` has no special case for signal 0 — unlike POSIX, 0 has no
    meaning to Win32 at all, so the call falls through to the general path
    and invokes ``TerminateProcess(handle, 0)``, which would ACTUALLY KILL
    the target process (confirmed via CPython's own issue tracker:
    https://bugs.python.org/issue14480, closed by a core dev with "0 has no
    special meaning on Windows so I'd rather not add another special case
    for posix emulation" — i.e. this is documented upstream behaviour, not
    an oversight this fix can rely on changing). Using it for a liveness
    check would be a live, safety-critical bug the moment this code ever
    runs on Windows: probing a stale/reused pid could kill an unrelated
    live process. Instead this calls the real Win32 liveness primitive,
    ``OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, ...)``: it succeeds
    (and the handle is immediately closed again) if a process with that pid
    exists, regardless of ownership — matching the POSIX
    ``PermissionError`` -> still-alive branch below — and fails if the pid
    does not correspond to a running process. Nothing is ever terminated,

    - the recorded pid is still alive -> ``"in-progress"`` (note: the pid may

    - dead pid: ask git whether the patch is already applied —

    Raising — rather than blocking — is the point: the caller is forced to make
    the deferral explicit. A dead holder's lease is reclaimed automatically, so a
    crashed lane cannot wedge the workspace.

    ``owner`` (D-CDX-14) is an optional, CALLER-DECLARED identity —
    e.g. ``{"fleet": "codex", "session": "..."}`` distinguishing the
    Claude/Codex/human/vLLM actor classes that arbitrate through this
    ledger — persisted into the lease record verbatim and returned by
    :func:`lease_status` so a holder can be attributed, not just located by
    ``lane``/``pid``/``host``. It is declared, not authenticated: this
    mechanism has no identity-verification step, so a caller can name any
    ``owner`` it likes. Nothing here (or in any caller) should treat an
    unset/mismatched ``owner`` as a security boundary — only the ``lane``
    lock itself (this lease + :func:`file_lock.lock_exclusive`) is enforced;
    ``owner`` is attribution for observability, not authorization.

    **verb-agnostic** — ``checkout``, ``restore``, ``clean``, ``reset``, a branch
    switch and a stash all destroy uncommitted work, so guarding one verb just
    moves the hazard.

    **Residual gap, stated plainly:** a lease only binds actors that take it. An
    unwrapped external process still races, and no amount of leasing changes
    that. The gap closes only by making the guarded wrapper the *only* way the
    long operation is run — see the ``lane lease -- <command>`` form and
    ``reports/PROGRAM.md``. Do not record this as solved.
