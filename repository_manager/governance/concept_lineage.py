"""Concept lineage — a concept may declare that a *parent* concept documents it.

CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.concept-lineage-parent-doc — parent-satisfied documentation.
CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.concept-lineage-rename — first-class RENAME disposition.

Why this exists
---------------
``check_concept_governance.py --audit-merged`` asks one question of every live
``CONCEPT:<id>`` marker: does a design document under ``.specify/design/**``
mention it? On 2026-07-31 that audit found **1,039 live concepts with no design
doc**, clustered into just 80 ``pillar.domain`` groups. Read naively, that is a
demand for 1,039 design documents.

It is not. Auditing one whole group (``AU-KG.compute``, 79 live concepts — see
``.specify/triage/AU-KG.compute.yaml``) resolved it to **21 design documents,
47 pointers and 11 retirements**. The pointers are markers *on code that
realises an already-decided thing*: sixteen ``source_sync``/``owl_bridge``/
``mcp_tool`` per-connector markers all realising ONE decision about how a
connector's entity types reach the graph; four ``numeric/`` markers all
realising ONE decision to drop numpy/scipy for a compiled kernel. Writing
seventeen documents for the first cluster would mean writing sixteen
restatements — which is worse than none, because a restatement satisfies the
gate, looks like documentation, and teaches nothing.

So the unit of documentation is the **decision**, not the marker. A cohesive
cluster needs ONE document plus N pointers. This module is the pointer: a
machine-checked, hand-authored declaration that ``child`` is covered by
``parent``'s design document.

The registry also records **retirements**: markers that were removed because
they never named a decision at all (an id auto-derived from a prose fragment,
say ``AU-KG.compute.when-exposes`` minted from the sentence "when the engine
exposes the native..."). Recording them is what makes retirement a ratchet
rather than a deletion — re-introducing a deliberately retired id is a gate
failure, not a silent regression.

A third disposition, **rename**, covers the case neither of the above fits: the
marker names a real decision, kept whole, that simply needs a different id —
most often because its domain word is not (or is no longer) in the closed
vocabulary (``repository_manager/governance/domain_vocab.yaml``,
``scripts/check_domain_vocab.py``). ``AU-KG.trace.canonical-id-non-idempotence``
was moved to ``AU-KG.identity.canonical-id-non-idempotence`` this way — before
this registry supported it as a first-class disposition, a sibling lane did it
by hand (source-edit + full ``docs/concepts.yaml`` regen) because ``trace`` was
never a registered ``KG`` domain. Unlike ``retire``, a rename is not "this named
nothing" — the decision survives under the new id, and ``renamed`` records the
old-to-new mapping so:

* re-introducing the OLD id is caught by
  ``scripts/check_concept_governance.py``'s ``reintroduced_renames`` (mirrors
  ``reintroduced_retirements``), the same ratchet property retirement has,
  rather than silently reviving a name that was deliberately moved away from;
  and
* :func:`Lineage.resolve` lets any caller that still holds the old id (a stale
  baseline entry, an old report) find where the decision lives now, without
  treating the old id as if it were still live.

``scripts/concept_domain_triage.py apply`` is the only writer: it renames every
marker site (source, tests, and any design doc that quotes the id literally) in
one step and records the provenance — never a hand-edit of this file plus a
manual find-and-replace.

Rules the loader enforces
-------------------------
Every rule below exists because breaking it would let the mechanism *hide* a
real decision, which is the only way this feature can do harm:

* **One hop only.** A ``parent`` may not itself be a ``child``. Chains make
  "is this documented?" a graph traversal whose terminus nobody checks; a
  two-hop chain ending at an undocumented root reads as documented at every
  intermediate step.
* **No self-parent, no cycles.** Implied by the one-hop rule, checked anyway
  so a malformed edit fails loudly instead of resolving to nothing.
* **A rationale, and not a restatement of the id.** The pointer must say
  *which* decision covers the marker and *why*, in words that are not simply
  the concept's own slug re-spelled. A pointer that restates its id is the
  same filler the design-doc rule already forbids.
* **Disjoint dispositions.** A concept is retired *or* linked *or* renamed
  (as the OLD id of a rename), never more than one.
* **A rename target must be a different, valid id, and a reason is required.**
  Self-rename is rejected the same way self-parent is.
* **No rename chains.** A rename's ``to`` may not itself be the OLD id of
  another rename entry — the same one-hop reasoning as parent chains. Renaming
  an id again means rewriting the *existing* entry's ``to`` (and every site) to
  point at the final name directly, which is exactly what
  ``concept_domain_triage.py apply`` does when it detects the target is itself
  mid-chain — it flattens rather than appending a second hop.

The gate (``check_concept_governance.py``) consumes :func:`load_lineage` and
treats ``has_design_doc(child) or has_design_doc(parent_of(child))`` as
documented — but only after verifying the parent genuinely has a document. A
parent link pointing at an undocumented parent is a *violation*, reported by
name, not a silent pass.
